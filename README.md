# Corporate Dashboard

This project is my milestone work for "Project 4: Corporate Dashboard" in [Senior Web Developer Udacity Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd802).

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Data

Run `php dataGenerator/generator.php` to (re)generate data in `app/data` folder.

App will detect changes and show them on the dashboard.

## Build & development

Do `npm install` and `bower install` to prepare dependencies.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Credits

Some styles were taken from AdminLTE template by [Almsaeed Studio](http://almsaeedstudio.com).
